An approach that refers to the contextual information is discussed in this paper. DocOIE, a new Dataset composed of 800 manually annotated
sentences with context awareness, is presented in this work DocOIEAbstract.
This DocOIE is used in the evaluation process of the DocIE model.
In fact, the presented system enables the extraction of relations with a documentlevel context awareness]DocIEAbstract.
